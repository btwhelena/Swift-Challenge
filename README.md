# Kitchen Assistant

Kitchen Assistant is a CLI application designed to help people weigh food for a recipe, without needing a scale.

The application works in a simple way and has the main ingredients used in recipes, such as wheat flour, sugar, etc. Measuring types include teacups, tablespoons, and teaspoons.

This application was built for the **Apple Developer Academy - IFCE** Swift Challenge, using **Challenge Based Learning** (CBL) framework.

## Learnings

This was one of my first experiences with Swift. In this challenge, I was able to learn the basics of Swift and how to use and decode a JSON file. I also learned to use Github and Xcode. I hope to continue developing applications and learn much more :)
